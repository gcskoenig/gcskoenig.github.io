I am interested in the development of sustainable machine learning and its application for the societal good.

I am a postdoc working on explainability with [Ulrike Luxburg](https://www.tml.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/research/index.php) at the University of TÃ¼bingen. Before that, I did my PhD with [Moritz Grosse-Wentrup](https://ni.cs.univie.ac.at/) and [Bernd Bischl](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/people/bischl/) at LMU Munich and Unversity of Vienna.
I'm a founding member of [ThinkTech](https://www.thinktech.ngo/) (prev. ConsciousCoders), helped start [WeRePack](https://werepack.org/de/) and contributed to initiatives like [data science for social good](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/data-science/warwick-data/dssgx/).

Before, I did my [M.Sc. Data Science at LMU Munich](https://www.m-datascience.mathematik-informatik-statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), funded by the elite network Bavaria and my Bachelor at TU Munich. Check out my [CV](/pdf/koenig-cv.pdf) for more details.

In my free time I enjoy repairing old race bikes, producing electronical music and good food.
