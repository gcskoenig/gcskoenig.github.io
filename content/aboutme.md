I am interested in the development of sustainable machine learning and its application for the societal good.

I am a PhD Candidate with [Prof. Moritz Grosse-Wentrup](https://ni.cs.univie.ac.at/) and [Prof. Bernd Bischl](https://www.slds.stat.uni-muenchen.de/people/bischl/) with research interests *causality* and *interpretable machine learning*.
I'm a founding member of [ThinkTech](https://www.thinktech.ngo/) (prev. ConsciousCoders), helped start [WeRePack](https://werepack.org/de/) and contributed to initiatives like [data science for social good](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/data-science/warwick-data/dssgx/).

Before, I did my [M.Sc. Data Science at LMU Munich](https://www.m-datascience.mathematik-informatik-statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), funded by the elite network Bavaria and my Bachelor at TU Munich. Check out my [CV](/pdf/koenig-cv.pdf) for more details.
